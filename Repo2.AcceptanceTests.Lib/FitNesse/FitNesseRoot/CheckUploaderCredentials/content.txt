As an end user, I want the system to prevent unauthorized users from uploading a package, so that I am protected from malicious/fraudulent content.

| Validate Uploader Credentials            |
|    username    | password  | can upload? |
| wrong_username | wrong_pwd |    no       |
|   $validUsr    | $validPwd |    yes      |
